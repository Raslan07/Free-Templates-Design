        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
        heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ”

        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the

        standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

      <p class="card__testimonial">
        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed structure from professionals who can
        help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
        say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
        took my learning to the next level. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
        development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
        offers. 100% recommend! ”
